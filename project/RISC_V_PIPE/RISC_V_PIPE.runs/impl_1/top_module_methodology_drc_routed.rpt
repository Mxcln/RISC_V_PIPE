2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock u_vga_top/u_vga_clk/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_100MHz and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_100MHz and clk_out1_vga_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_100MHz] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_vga_clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_100MHz and clk_out1_vga_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_100MHz] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_vga_clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock u_vga_top/u_vga_clk/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin u_vga_top/u_vga_clk/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell u_risc_v_soc/u_ram/rgb_data[10]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) u_vga_top/u_vga_control/addr_h_reg[0]/CLR, u_vga_top/u_vga_control/addr_h_reg[10]/CLR, u_vga_top/u_vga_control/addr_h_reg[11]/CLR, u_vga_top/u_vga_control/addr_h_reg[1]/CLR, u_vga_top/u_vga_control/addr_h_reg[2]/CLR, u_vga_top/u_vga_control/addr_h_reg[3]/CLR, u_vga_top/u_vga_control/addr_h_reg[4]/CLR, u_vga_top/u_vga_control/addr_h_reg[5]/CLR, u_vga_top/u_vga_control/addr_h_reg[6]/CLR, u_vga_top/u_vga_control/addr_h_reg[7]/CLR, u_vga_top/u_vga_control/addr_h_reg[8]/CLR, u_vga_top/u_vga_control/addr_h_reg[9]/CLR, u_vga_top/u_vga_control/addr_v_reg[0]/CLR, u_vga_top/u_vga_control/addr_v_reg[10]/CLR, u_vga_top/u_vga_control/addr_v_reg[11]/CLR (the first 15 of 3713 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
